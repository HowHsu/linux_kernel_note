# linux_kernel_note
my way to linux kernel

This repo is to track my learning process on linux kernel. I'll mostly
write up new knowledge I get and my little thinking on it.
I'll really appreciate it if you star this repo after you got anything
you like through reading my posts.
Meanwhile, all the criticism and thoughts are welcomed, post them in
the issue list with no hesitation.:)
